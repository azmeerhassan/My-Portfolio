<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Azmeer Hassan Ammad, currently pursuing a BE in Computer System from Dawood 
  University. I am passionate about web development and programming, with a strong interest in 
  becoming a full stack web developer. Throughout my journey, I have gained experience in 
   programming language like C++, and I am constantly expanding my knowledge 
   of front-end and back-end technologies. My goal is to build dynamic, responsive websites 
   that provide excellent user experiences.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to teach for two years in 
  both the Federal and Cambridge systems, helping students grasp complex technical concepts. 
  This experience has honed my communication skills and deepened my understanding of how to 
  approach problems effectively. I enjoy breaking down complicated topics into manageable 
  pieces and find teaching a rewarding way to reinforce my own learning.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I am focused on excelling in my studies and improving my GPA. I am 
  committed to pushing my technical skills to the next level, and I look forward to the 
  challenges and opportunities that will help me grow into a well-rounded full stack developer.
   Continuous learning, discipline, and creativity drive my approach to both personal and 
   professional development.</p>
